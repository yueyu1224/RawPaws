      <h2>Raw Food Information</h2>      
      <p>The raw food diet for pets, often referred to as the BARF diet (Biologically Appropriate Raw Food or Bones and Raw Food), is based on fresh, raw ingredients that aim to provide a more natural eating experience. Proponents of the diet suggest that it can lead to shinier coats, healthier skin, improved dental health, and higher energy levels.</p>
      
      <p>Many supporters of raw feeding believe that because this diet is closer to what animals would eat in the wild, it contributes to a more robust digestive system. The natural enzymes in raw food are also thought to help pets absorb nutrients more effectively, leading to improved overall health.</p>
